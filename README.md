# React Native Utils #

This is a simple command line utility to help create the basic patterns that I use when working on react native projects and initialize them with the `create-react-native-app` utility.

## Functions ##

**Setup Typescript**

**Create Directory Structure**

**Setup Storybook**

**Create Component**

**Create Screen**

**Create Mobx Store**
